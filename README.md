# ðŸ“ˆ Fed Day SPY Strategy Backtester

This is a simple backtesting tool that evaluates a SPY trading strategy centered around U.S. Federal Reserve (FOMC) meeting dates. Built with Streamlit, it allows you to interactively adjust parameters and visualize the performance of the strategy.

## ðŸ§  Strategy Logic

The strategy goes long on SPY **one day after an FOMC meeting**, but only **if SPY declined in the 2 days leading up to the meeting**. The position is then held for a customizable number of days.

You can test how this rule performs historically by tweaking the holding period and pre-FOMC drop threshold.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- âœ… Choose pre-FOMC drop threshold (e.g., -1%)
